bedroom,"You stand up from your bed. You remember just how small this room actually is. So small in fact, that you sometimes have trouble moving about. This is what happens when your house was demolished and later rebuilt from your own bank. Your bare feet touch the dusty floor. You would have looked down in disgust, but you're used to it by now. The room is outlined with a firm stone brick wall and right in front of you is a small wooden door.  ","You stare at the grey stone brick walls which line the tiny room. On one corner, you see a small painting of a young woman. Many people find it strange that you have a young woman's painting hanging on your old walls, that is until you tell them who she actually is. On your small table you notice your lantern. Above your bed lies a small gated window, providing the bright sunlight into your room. ",door_home
home,"You open the door and are suddenly greeted by the warm comfort of your home. The walls are as thick as your hand and you feel safe knowing they can protect you from the outside dangers, even though your home has been safe ever since the incident happened seventeen years ago. You sit down on a chair. The ceiling is higher than your tiny bedroom, which you are extremely grateful of. ","You look around the room. You see a large window shining the light into your home. You turn around and are greeted by a warm fireplace made out of stone. Ontop of the fireplace is a lantern. To the right of the fireplace, you a wooden door that  has a small window made of iron bars. You instantly know that is your entrance door, which would lead you outside. To the left is another door, but smaller which leads you to your bedroom. There are a few hanging torches, all of which have been put out, making the room dark. You look around to see if there any important items here.","bedroom_bedroom, outside_frontyard"
frontyard,"The air is warm and fresh. You breath it all in. You look around, and you see your small home, with a large brown door, sorrunded by a large dark forest. You turn around south and see a long stone path that leads into the horizon, and from what appears to be miles and miles ahead, you see a small town. ","You stare at the small stone bricks which create your entire house. It seems quite small, especially when compared to the vast amout of gigantic homes you've seen on your journey, but it does it's work. You stare at the wilderness that sorounds your home. You like it here. The quietness. Ever since the incident, you prefer things to be as silent as possible. Luckily, you live in the 14th Era of Silence. ","door_home, home_home, north_lakeside, south_commoner's path, path_commoner's path, inside_home"
commoner's path,"You've been walking for several minutes. You remember this road from so long ago. You feel the brittle stone pushing against your cold feet. You think back to long forgotten memories of your mother and father. Your father told you that when you were just a baby, they moved north of Delan. Soon they had constructed this path. As you walk through it, you feel the light breeze on your dry skin. ","You stare north and see your home in the distant. You turn around and stare south, here you can barely see the town of Delan, but the most notable thing you see is the smoke coming out of the many homes located there. It makes your life easier traversing through the land. As you continue to walk, you stare east, facing the Ancient Forest. You have never once entered inside, for fear of what dangers might lurk. Although you have heard that they are all stories for little childern, you can't help but think they're true. ","north_frontyard, east_town, south_crossroad1, west_forest west"
traveler's road,"You've been walking for several hours now, soon after your feet will become sore. You always despised this trip, but this is what happens when you live in the east of Galoroid, and far from the capital, Adoreithien. The road seems to be in much better shape than Commoner's road, which makes sense considering this road leads to an entire town, instead of just your own house. ","As you walk along, you cannot help but stare at the opposite sides of the wide road. You notice that both the east and west sides are just fields of grass with very few trees that go on for hundreds upon hundreds of miles. You remember what you had learnt reading some history books. There was once a time, durng the Fifth Era of Peace, where Galoroid was filled with men. Cities sprouted from the ground every thousand years, and no matter where you looked, you could find shelter. Now, all that is left is a barren image of what once was a great country. Staring south, you can faintly see Edverd's road, which leads straight into the heart of Galoroid. ","south_edverd's road mid, north_crossroad1"
traitor's road,"It has been serveral hours now. Your legs have grown weary during your travels. As you walk through the road, you cannot help but think how painful it must be for all the guards stationed at the prison. Having to walk this far, only to guard a bunch of men who have commited terrible crimes. You think of it as sad for the guards, and yet you admire the location this path leads for the criminals. ","As you walk, you stare towards the west. All you see is a barren wasteland. Further south it was more green, but the more north you're going, the colder it will be, and as a result, less life. Now all you observe is a frozen wasteland of snow, and very few grass. The east is similar, except you can see the Darakeein mountains. These are the smallest mountains in allof  eastern Galoroid, but standing from here, they seem towering in their snow capped roofs. ","north_prison outside, south_edverd's road west"
edverd's road mid,"You've been walking for hours upon hours now. Your feet are hurting so much so that it feels like you just walked on the prickly sands of Zanrathra. As much as you would love to rest here, you know you are not safe out in the middle of Edverd's Road.","As you walk along for miles on end, you stare to your south. Here, you see a vast open field. You stare deep into the barren meadows and realize this is where the Great Battle of Largaghast took place, over two hundred thousand years ago. It is quiet as you walk past the desolate ground. To the west you finally see it: The faint image of Adoreithian, capital of Galoroid. Even from hundreds of miles away, it seems massive. Staring towards the north, you finally catch a glimmer of another path. You recognize it to be Traitor's road. It is quite small, but leads directly into the Prison of Maghakroom.","north_traveler's road, west_edverd's road west, east_edverd's road east, south_field"

However, now the field is becoming greener as you walk, with more life sprouting from the ground. As you stare towards the west, you realize you can now see the entirety of Adoreithian. It's walls are towering from so far away, and its hall of kings, where King Salazere resides, towers over all.  ","north_traitor's road, west_adoreithien gate, east_edverd's road mid"

You arrived at the gigantic gold gate, leading inside Adoreithien, capital of Galoroid. ","You stare up, and the gate seems to be as large as an entire mountain. Though you remember this is what happens when you have over 200,000 years of building. You look to your sides, and your mouth drops when you realize that the walls go on forever.

You turn around and walk towards the stone wall. Something about it seems... off. The stone seems to predate any known material you have ever seen. You walk towards the other side.

All that remains on the ground is pools of ash. What remains is a giant ring as wide as an entire house. You ponder if anyone has ever discoveed such a thing. They must have... Galaroid's recorded history dates back over a million years. But could this be as old, if not older than that? You then realize where you are. You look up, and you see the towering mountains of Antradiluvian. You can just imagine that these peaks rise so high that they touch the other realms beyond. Legend has it Antradiluvian was here even before the Eon of Known. Could it be? The portal was from the same time? A time we have long forgotten?",west_forest east

You look around and gaze at the unidentifiable runes and glyphs scoured across the walls. Many of them depicting beasts of legend such as dragons, Golems, Death Worms, Rocs, Basalisks, or even the Dullahan. You realize that this temple must be atleast from the Fifth Era. ",north_desert

Every step you take, you gaze at what could have been warriors of old running into their deaths.
