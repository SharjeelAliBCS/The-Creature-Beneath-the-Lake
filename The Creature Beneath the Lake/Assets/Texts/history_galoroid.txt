Before there was time, before all of recorded history. There was a period known only as “Eon of Unknown.”. Many scholars tried to decipher this, try to understand what exactly this period was, but with no prevail. This eon, from what little we know is around  1,480,507 years old. Placing it further back in time than we could ever dream of. This period goes so far back in time, some say men did not even exist. Although, we have very faint records of ancient ruins discovered during the Tenth Era. What little we have is simple: Only primitive, old ruins. Nothing more. No grand cities like Adoreithien, Zanaithi, or Relend. So, this points to the fact that men existed even back then. Sadly, there is nothing more to discuss about this forgotten eon, save for one last thing. 

The eon was succeeded by another, the “eon of known.”, the period in which we live today. The first era was known as “Awakening”, a name which fits quite well. This era lasted for 380,343 years, and is the longest of all fourteen known ones. I have a plausible reason for this. During the beginning of the second era, we see many cities and structures which are similar to the might of ours today. My best guess is that the reason for why the first era was so long was that it was a slow build up. After the unknown ended, the first era started, and from then on everything was coming into being. Well by everything, I am talking about men’s true might. The ancient scrolls found at the Site of Yaviah, during the battle of traitors- 5E 4454, suggests that the first era ended with the discovery of new lands far beyond Galoroid. Something we shall talk about later.
. 
The Second Era of Expansion lasted for 160,121 years and was a time where man expanded throughout the world of Altima. Records for this are still very much small, but there is at the very least more than the first era’s. During this era, lands such as Valbra, Keteos, and Wuraangu, were all discovered outside of Galoroid, and subsequently colonized by man. Another major discovery was found during this period, being new races of men like creatures as intelligent as us, some would say even more. During the last 30,000 years, man had allied themselves with the Hawrim; a race of men with the heads of birds. This alliance was very prominent throughout history, up until the Seventh Era. There is sadly no real information about the bridge between the Second Era and the third. This, in my opinion is due to the shared similarities between both.

Anyway, the third Era of Discovery lasted for 105,445 years, and was a time of a new. By this, I mean the  Intellectual revolution, which started somewhere near the first five thousand years of this era. This great event is characterized by the appearance of true sorcerers and scholars, and the building of magnificat cities as large as Adoreithien. Some scholars suggest that this era actually started due to the Intellectual Revolution, though there is more evidence pointing towards the revolution taking place a few thousand years into the third era instead. Around the time of the Intellectual Revolution, a very powerful and intelligent wizard only known as Konorim formed an order: The Order of Undying Wisdom, the same order that I, and all true scholars belong to. Later, once his order amassed a thousand followers, he erected the Grand Library of Konorim, which even to this day stands, and houses all collections of works written throughout time, some even being the originals. Of course these would last forever, but for some odd reason we have, and  I personally read scrolls written during the Fourth Era! Another prominent event that changed the world forever was the creation of the Order of Warlords during the last three thousand years. Very powerful men who were exceptionally gifted at combat. Though, there is little evidence for the founding to take place here. This era ends with something very few believe actually existed: The introduction of the beasts of legend. 

The Fourth Era of Peril lasted for 172,898 years, and was characterized by the sudden appearance of legendary creatures into Altima. There is some confusion as to why there was a sudden introduction here. Many say that the beasts were always around prior to the fourth era, and just waited their time till man was ready, others say that the gods created them to test man’s might. Another theory suggests that man had always encountered them, but the records recorded were left blank. Nonetheless, this era was frequent with many deaths, and the great plague of Xarim, which haunted man for twelve thousand years. This era did however end on a good note. Scrolls dated for the last dozen or so years of the fourth era frequently showcase dragons, golems, and Wuraangu death worms, just to name a few. Later scrolls showed man even riding these beasts.

The Fifth Era of Legends lasted for 164,333 years, and was met with the alliance between certain races of legendary creatures and man. Of course, the greatest would be with dragons, where man rode them into numerous battles. Of course, this meant that battles and wars became even more fierce, which is proven by ancient books discussing such things as the battle of Undulim, the War for Keland. The interesting thing here is that the war for keland resulted in the creation of Reland, a province which was previously Keland and Racivar. During the later half of the era, things were beginning to slow down. Discoveries decreased, new technologies ceased to be created entirely, and even the deaths of men due to legendary beasts dwindled. Then, during the final thirty years, a mysterious man appeared who called himself the  
Primordial, united all of Altima under peace. Thus, ending the fifth Era. 

The Sixth Era of Peace lasted for 172,054  years, and during this time, Altima witnessed its first ever era of peace ever since the gods created it. Due to this event, there is not much to really discuss as there were no recorded wars taking place. Although small scale battles, such as the Ransacking of Konorim’s library took place. Which, luckily, only gold was taken, and not any of the priceless records. Anyhow, during the last ten thousand years, something terrible happened. Men looked around their backs, and realized the legendary beasts were disappearing. Dragons and Rocs frequented the sky less and less, walking through the desert became a safe passage instead of doom due to the disappearing death worms. This worried the kingdoms so much that they declared a new era. And from then on, our world has become a shadow of its former self. 

The Seventh Era of Extinction lasted for  52,309 years, and with it, the disappearance of all the beasts of legends. Many of them, the Nykur, the Minotaur of the Azahain Maze, banshees, basilisks, centaurs, even dragons soon turned into legends. This leads into our next topic. Why is it that for the past 300,00 years, the only land that we know of is Galoroid? No one knows exactly why, but during the Seventh Era, men frequented lands outside Galoroid less and less. The north became harsher to us, and the many races we allied with, such as the Hawrim disappeared back to their forgotten lands. Trade routes soon closed, and all that remained was a once strong race of men, turned weak. Then came the truth. The Primordial, for all he was to the realm, told the kingdoms the cause for the disappearance: They were being hunted down, and as a result, they hid, and disappeared into the other realms of Existence. Some kingdoms, such as Relend and Galared held some of the legendary beasts to almost godhood, such as the  leviathan, dragons, Sphinx and the Roc. Soon the peace which held them together was being torn apart. They turned on each other, and in time battles fought accusing the other of mass extinction. Alas, during the last thousand years, they had forgotten the very reason for this hatred, as the beasts and lands beyond faded into legends for crazed men. Then, the country declared war. And with it, the Ten Thousand Year War began. 

The Seventh Era of War is the shortest of all eras, lasting only 10,012 years, but the most devastating. The war turned a once prosperous Galoroid into a desolate country. All men of able bodied age were forced to have brides, and to yield a child before they were then forced to head to battle. Only once they served for ten years could they return home. The kingdoms of Gilamish, Yariam, Jounathel, Varam, Qusiaham, Aleitrim, Lonnotian, and Faragard all fell. For the last two thousand years, only two remained. Relend And Galared. Mass graves were dug outside the capitals, but the war kept on raging on like a storming fire. Men and women alike urged the crowns to stop this madness, to declare some form of peace. This kept on going until the year 7E 10,007 with the murder of King Erik of Galared. This caused the legendary prince Edverd, to be crowned king Edverd, and his first act as king was not to lay down his men, no. It was to charge into the province of Relend with five hundred thousand strong, he even ordered some of the retired men to join his cause, for which many happily did. That battle was an utter defeat, and the remaining army of Galared returned home. Without their king. No one knows what exactly occured, but he rode to the capital on the back of a dragon. He allied himself with the young warrior and princess of Relend, Anithia. Together they realized the truth: The Primordial from hundreds of thousands of years ago was a wicked evil. The cause for this great war. He had tricked the ten kingdoms into declaring war through the murder of the legendary beasts, which he himself had committed. Once the two kingdoms found out. They charged into battle. The last year of the Seventh Era of War was marked with the battle for Galoroid, where millions, from both the Primordial's and the kingdom’s forces perished. But in the end, Edverd lunged his sword into his heart, ending his life. But legend has it, he uttered something: This Era shall become only legend, mortal. Legends shall become nothing, but tainted memories of crazed men”. No one to this day truly understands what he was, or how he came to such power to command entire armies and slay such beasts. All we know is that he a dark force from outside our realm. Some even say he will return, and with it the Third Eon would begin. None the less, after his defeat, the Ten Thousand Year War ended, and the new Era started. 

The Ninth Era of Reconciliation lasted for 15,067 years, and was quite simply mending back the broken trust that the men of Galoroid had for countless generations. During this era, the great capital of Adoreihtian was constructed under King Salazere the First’s rule. Relend and Galared swore loyalty to the new crown, and assumed their roles as provinces for the country. With this, new cities were built such as the cities of Jariam, Torahign, and Zebarah. The order of Warlords became the King’s most trusted advisors, and with it the tenth era began. 

The Tenth Era of Unification lasted for 21,898 years, and was when Galoroid was truely returning to its former glory. Of course, no scholar can deny that it was never once as prosperous as it was during the Fifth Era, but still. New provinces such as Zanitha were founded, which led to the city of Zanaithi being formed as its capital. This era ended when King Xeronos of Galaroid looked deep into justice, and for the last ten years of the tenth era, spent much of his resources in creating a system that would house all prisoners. 

The Eleventh Era of Justice lasted for 53,907 years, and during the first hundred years, the Great prison of Maghakroom was erected near the snowy mountains of Iolo. The first thousand years was a time of great achievement. Crime quickly decreased, and the generations of kings of Galaoid all helped in creating a truly stable economy. This quickly led to the Order of Undying Wisdom declaring the new era. 

The Twelfth Era of Order lasted for  76,685 years, and was quite simply boring. Nothing very big had occurred during this time, so as a result, we shall skip over this. If you wish to read more about this, my dear friend  Alik Volstrum has written many books pertaining to the boring aspects such as this. 

The Thirteenth Era of Dissolve lasted for 38,232 years and was characterized by the disappearance of strange, or phenomenal things. Everything around us became normalized. Of course by this time, everyone believed the history I am telling is rubbish. More on that later, but nothing big truly occurred, except for King Erik of Galaroid, and all his success stopped believing in the legendary beasts, or even the Primordial. Funny thing, this era was actually ended due to King Stafen declaring that he got ‘bored’ and found that calling this era ‘dissolve’ didn't suit it's quite boring name. So the Fourteenth, and present era was created. The Fourteenth Era of Silence. 

All in all, having now hopefully read all of this you have chosen to either believe in this history, which has been thoroughly gathered and checked by the Order of Undying Wisdom, or you can believe in the rubbish that many people call this. What is my stance on this? On the ancient forgotten lands, end beasts of legend? Well I believe they exist. And what of the Primordial? The very being who supposedly caused the extinction of all legends, and caused Galaoird to fall for ten thousand years? I believe he existed. To the full extent of what the stories say. And most importantly, when he returns, I believe that if we defeat him. Truly… We shall resurrect all of Altima for the Third Eon to begin.  And with it, the return of legends.
