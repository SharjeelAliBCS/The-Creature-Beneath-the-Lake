Dear son,
I know that you do not wish to ever hear from me again. I understand that sentiment, and your well founded hate for me. But, please come visit me one last time. I am growing old, and I am dying. It won’t be long before the gods ferry my soul across the realms. And… I think it is time you learnt the truth about what happened to your mother. If I die before you see me, then I am sorry son. But the truth will remain buried with my corpse. 
Yours truly,
Father
