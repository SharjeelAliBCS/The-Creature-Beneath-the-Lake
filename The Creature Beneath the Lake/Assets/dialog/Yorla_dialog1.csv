how's life,Are you trying to flirt with me?
what happened,"Something terrible. Just this morning, I got word that Renaila's son went missing. Some of the men went out and tried to look for him, and they couldn't find him at all. It's been hours. Even I'm getting worried for the poor boy. "
what did you see,"Listen, all I saw was Renaila, the boy's mother come crashing in here. Then suddenly, all of the dam guards and men took over my traven. I'm not complaining, but I hope they find him soon. Good thing this town has some good people. "
where's Renaila,She should be outside on the porch. It would be amazing if you could help us.
