ask about horse,"The- the horse! You want to know more? By the gods it's happening again. Isn't it? I could never wish such a thing upon anyone. Well, ask away. What do you want to know?"
ask about footprint,"So. You saw a footprint. That was backwards. Gods, that was the first sign something was wrong when we had encountered it all those years ago. It's not until you actually gaze upon the real thing that you truly fear its power, its abnormality. "
ask about wet,"Yes, the lakeside near Esriena's Tear was wet when we went. We never questioned why, we were just. Just happy. I just wish I could take it all back and rewind time. "
ask about name,"That horse. I tried to find out its name, but it was too late. Once Delan had heard of what happened to her- They- they stormed our home. Destroyed parts of it, and took me away from you. All that I had left. Now in here, they don't let us read or anything. We are trapped here, just by ourselves and our minds slowly turning mad. "
where to go,"The Grand Library of Konorim. I was planning on going, well till the guards showed up at our gate. Go there, and ask for the scholar named Alik Volstrum. He should be of help soon. I assume we are seeing eacother again? You know, I could never be more happy. I just hope you realize the truth in my old words."
