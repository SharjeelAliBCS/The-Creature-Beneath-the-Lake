ask about letter,"Oh, so you got my letter. Well I am glad you have come all this way. To meet me. Anir has not been kind to me for all these years. "
ask about mother,"I didn't kill her son. I could never. Your mother, by the gods was  she beautiful. Her eyes were as blue as the ocean. Her hair was red as the autumn leaves that fall. I can still remember her soft voice echoing through my hed. Oh sweet dreams of late do I have. I wish  I could embrace her warm body, tell her how much I miss her. How sorry I am. Sorry for failing her. I am growing old, and soon I will pass this realm like our forefathers to finally join her."
who killed mother,"Seventeen years ago, out on our little farmhouse, where the grass was always green and the sun rose as brught as every previous day. Where the wind was still with warmth We all lived as one family. You were just six what it happened. When the walls protecting us crashed and burned down. You were at home, playing with the dogs from what I could recall. Your mother and I however were out in Delan. Once we were done there, we strode on Commoner's path. Your mother stared into the surrounding forest, and out into the sunlight. I stood there, on our carriage and asked her what was wrong. Her voice was soothing, even when she was worried. ' I've been thinking, we never got to see the sunset over the lake.' I would be lying if I said I didn't laugh. So, much to her suprise I said we'd go that very day. The sun was still bright, but now it was a warm orange instead. We jumped out of our carriage, and headed towards the lake. The meadow was as large as Delan itself. It seemed like we had walked for days on end, but I remember staring at her gorgeous face as I held her soft hand. Once we approached the lake, I finally understood why they called it  Esriena's Tear. We both lay on the warm ground, staring at the tear of the lifegiver. Then we saw it.  "
what did you see,"A horse. It was as white as snow, with a long silver mane running across its back. Your mother couldn't resist. I tried to stop her- Bu- But I couldn't. She walked straight up towards it. I- I had to protect her. Then I noticed something odd. The horse's mane. It was dripping wet. As if it had just been soaked in water. But then. The rest of the body seemed dry. I looked straight at its black eyes. And it stared right into mine. It's pupil reflected my worried face. I dare not touch it. Then I saw your mother. She- She was touching it. Th- Then she got ontop of it. I tried telling her to get off. Bu - But she kept on joking about me not being any fun. I looked down at the horses feet. Its hooves. They were backwards. I suddenly yelled at her to get off. Then I saw the horses evil gaze.Panic set in. She screamed, telling me she was stuck, or glued. I tried grabbing her but she wouldn't budge. Th- Then he horse grew cold, it's skin became wet and dullish grey. Its back streched out and became slender like a shark. I gazed at its head. The skin was slimy and black. She kept on screaming, and I. I didn't know what to do.I tried hurting the beast, but I was powerless. Then. Then I watched it slowly move towards the lake. The very thing that came out of the Godess's eyes, turned into hell. I ran and ran, but it was too late. The horse- demon, jumped into the lake. I followed, but I wasn't fast enough. The last thing I saw. I saw her hand reaching out to me. I. I couldn't do anyhting!. I- I watched her sink  into the depths. I - I'm so sorry son."
what happened,"I am growing old son, I wish to see your handsome face once more, and to tell you about your mother."
