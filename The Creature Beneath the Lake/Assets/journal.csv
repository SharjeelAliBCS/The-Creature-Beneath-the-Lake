objective
"This is strange. My father has not contacted me for over seven years. Why would he do it now? Something isn't quite right. For as much as I hate him, I must still go and see him. Besides, it'll take me out of Bathiul. Something I should have done months ago. "
"Something is wrong with my father. He seems crazier than the last time I met him, and yet my anger still grows. I feel like punching him in the stomach, yelling at him for all that he has done to me! That son of a bitch murdered my mother! I- I need to head back to Delan. I've had enough of his shit for a lifetime now. Did he really think he could tell me a story about a mythical creature? No one believes in that, not anymore. "
"It felt good talking to Crydus after so long. We grew up together. While he always helped his father out on the farm, I was too busy worrying about how to survive in this world. But, Crydus has helped me along the way. He got me working for Yorla at her traven. Well, looks like it's almost night. I should be heading home soon. "
A new day has started. You decide it is time to resume your work at Yorla's Traven. 
Investigate the lake.
Find signs of what happened
You don't know what to think. All you know is that you need to visit your father once more in Maghakroom.
You start to believe your father after all these years. But you need more than just his word. You decide to go to the Grand Library of Konorim to find out more about this horse.
"The mysterious Scholar has told you to head north, to the Forbiddon Tower of Daraghasm to finally learn the truth. "
"Arkneras has told you that you require a single strand of Nykur hair. He, unfortunately forgot to mention where to look. You decide to scour the east of Galoroid to find it.  "
You have finally found it. A single black strand of wet hair. You must now return to the lake before it's too late.
Prevent the child from being taken.
"Visit your father in The Prison of Maghakroom to ask for forgiveness, and tell him he was right. All along. "
You realize your mission isn't over yet. You can still stop the Nykur. But you need help. You head to Adoreithian's Hall of Kings
Speak with the King
"Arkneras has decided to help you. He says we must go to Azrazham, an ancient, long forgotten temple of the Warlord Order."
"You fear you and Arkneras may not be able to stop the Nykur alone. You must ask your friend, Crydus for help. "
It is time. Head to the lake for one final push.
You've had enough. Slay the Nykur. 
"Head back to doreithian's Hall of Kings, and show the kingdom what you have done. "
"You have become tired, and wish to see your mother and father once more, but now together at last. Head to the graves of Galoroid."
