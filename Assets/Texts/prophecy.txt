In a time without time, 
In a land without sea, without grass
There was one,
One who was there before all others,
One who was the first,
The first to lay his gaze on Altima,
The first to rule before everything was Known. 

Time will pass, 
And with it, an Eon anew, 
He shall disappear from the cold sky,
And watch men rise with all their might

He shall gaze down upon the bright new world, 
And when it is time, 
He shall return
The beasts of Legend shall fall, 
One by one, the kingdoms shall harbour anger,
And with it, a war so long,
Altima shall be forgotten,
And with it, he shall rise from the ashes,
To reclaim his true achievement, 
To erase the beasts of legend from existence,
To forget the lands outside land,
To rule all of Altima. 
He calls himself the Primordial, the first of all men. 


You look closer. Could it be? The ancient fabled prophecy about the Primordial? A relic from even before the Eon of known? Impossible. It would have to be well over a million years old. You stare at the ruins, imagining that these stone bricks predate all you have known. Your hair stands up on your back. You know the legends say this being caused the ten thousand year war, and yet you hope to the gods that this prophecy was never true, because if it is... 
All of Altima shall fall.
